We\\'re hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \\n\\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it\\'s much better to respond in public comments, at least until you\\'ve gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###Summary###\\n\\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it\\'s unwise to trust them.** \\n\\n\\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it\\'s just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\\n\\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you\\'ll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you\\'ll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \\n\\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don\\'t give their names and callers aren\\'t allowed to request specific responders.  It\\'s much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it\\'s much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It\\'s partly about availability, but it\\'s mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \\n\\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it\\'s much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can\\'t see or police PMs.)  \\n\\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There\\'s no reason why someone who\\'s truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \\n\\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they\\'ve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone\\'s in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\\n\\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don\\'t recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.',\n",

If you\\'re having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, or have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these aren\\'t allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule),  this is a place you can share.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nOur subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click \\'report\\' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\\n\\nWe also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn\\'t a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn\\'t -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\\n\\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:\\n\\n- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\\n\\n- \"I\\'m here to help\" posts. This shows that you don\\'t understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\\n\\n- Role modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that\\'s what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\\n\\n- Content that\\'s more about \\'making a statement\\' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).\\n\\n- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.',\n",

If you&amp;#39;re having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, or have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these aren&amp;#39;t allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the &amp;quot;role model&amp;quot; rule),  this is a place you can share.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Our subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click &amp;#39;report&amp;#39; on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression&lt;/a&gt; provides guidance about what is and isn&amp;#39;t a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the &amp;quot;depression&amp;quot; label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help&lt;/a&gt; offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn&amp;#39;t -- usually helpful in giving peer support.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m here to help&amp;quot; posts. This shows that you don&amp;#39;t understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The &amp;quot;giving help&amp;quot; wiki explains more about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Role modelling, i.e. &amp;quot;achievement&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;advice&amp;quot; posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that&amp;#39;s what peer support means (rule 5). We know that &amp;quot;internet culture&amp;quot; celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content that&amp;#39;s more about &amp;#39;making a statement&amp;#39; or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The &amp;quot;what is depression&amp;quot; wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Its even worse because the person she is going to get officially married to (they have met a couple of times) abuses her, he literally shouts and blames her for things that she hasn't even done and even choked her before as well.\\n\\nShe told her parents about it but they just say that these things happen in a marriage which is bullshit, you don't hurt your own partner for any reason at all. We talked about our future marriage together so often, I genuinely did envision her as my wife and the mother to our kids but now I have to lose my soulmate to someone that abuses her. She even said that the only reason she is living is because of me, then after she gets kids she will live for them but it hurts just thinking about her having children with someone else, especially someone that abuses her.\\n\\nWhat do I even do here? I really am heartbroken and I literally cant do anything. We live in different countries, the only thing I can do is just watch someone I love be taken away by someone else who abuses her. I really don't know how I will get over this, I will never get over her\",\n",

I wasn\\'t waking up everyday feeling like I wanted to kill myself for the first time in my life.\\n\\nBut I haven\\'t been to therapy within that time frame and recently just sort of relapsed hard into a depressive episode. It\\'s weird. I feel awful and I\\'m crying everyday and have all these intrusive thoughts but this depression doesn\\'t feel the way it did before the meds. It feels different. \\n\\nAnyways, everyone around me (even when I wasnt medicated) is used to me being the funny happy-go-lucky hype man. And when I would slip into these more depressive episodes, I\\'d hide away. Cuz I knew no one wanted to see me this way.\\n\\nBut this time, I\\'ve been trying to be more transparent with people I thought could handle me being sad. But they can\\'t. They get uncomfortable. And have said they feel uncomfortable because they don\\'t know how to help. And as much as I\\'d like to say it doesn\\'t bug me, it does. \\n\\nIt sucks that when my friends are in a bad place I\\'m happy to just sit in it with them. But when I\\'m in this depression pit, they would prefer if I did isolate until I\\'m \"back\" to my old self. They won\\'t say it. But that\\'s how it feels.\\n\\nI hate hiding. And I wish I didn\\'t have to. I wish my friends would sit in it with me too sometimes. I wish people I loved still liked me when I\\'m like this. ',\n",

       "     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have persistent depression. Almost two years ago I started meds and it helped a lot. I wasn&amp;#39;t waking up everyday feeling like I wanted to kill myself for the first time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But I haven&amp;#39;t been to therapy within that time frame and recently just sort of relapsed hard into a depressive episode. It&amp;#39;s weird. I feel awful and I&amp;#39;m crying everyday and have all these intrusive thoughts but this depression doesn&amp;#39;t feel the way it did before the meds. It feels different. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, everyone around me (even when I wasnt medicated) is used to me being the funny happy-go-lucky hype man. And when I would slip into these more depressive episodes, I&amp;#39;d hide away. Cuz I knew no one wanted to see me this way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But this time, I&amp;#39;ve been trying to be more transparent with people I thought could handle me being sad. But they can&amp;#39;t. They get uncomfortable. And have said they feel uncomfortable because they don&amp;#39;t know how to help. And as much as I&amp;#39;d like to say it doesn&amp;#39;t bug me, it does. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It sucks that when my friends are in a bad place I&amp;#39;m happy to just sit in it with them. But when I&amp;#39;m in this depression pit, they would prefer if I did isolate until I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;back&amp;quot; to my old self. They won&amp;#39;t say it. But that&amp;#39;s how it feels.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hate hiding. And I wish I didn&amp;#39;t have to. I wish my friends would sit in it with me too sometimes. I wish people I loved still liked me when I&amp;#39;m like this. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I have sickle cell anemia and it has been getting worse over time. As of typing this I am having a pain crisis, which is considered one of the most painful things in the world. Standing for too long, walking for too long, being too cold or hot, basically anything can trigger this. This makes getting a job or making friends really hard. I can't do what most people can. I haven't had a friend since I was about 12 years old. \\n\\n  All of this to say, I am at my limit. I live with my mother and 5 siblings and can't do anything. My apartment is infested with roaches, the elevator always breaks, our ac has been broken for almost a year and I live in Los Angeles. Summer is approaching and extreme heat causes pain. I can barely walk for  more than 5 minutes before my legs hurt. 3 stairs makes my heart beat like crazy. A shower that is longer than 10 mins makes me almost faint. I want to be free and do things, but I have no skills, no money, and can't drive. And trust me I want to drive but I can't because of my extreme anxiety. Even driving the grocery store cart things make me nervous. The idea of even riding a bike down the street scares me. I have ADHD and have no idea what I want to do with my life, let alone something my body will allow me to do. All of the things I can think of that I would like to do need so much schooling and I'm tired of being a broke college student who relies on her disabled mother for everything. \\n\\n  I wish there was a redo button to my life. The only thing I can do is end it. I've attempted twice in my life, once at 12 and again at 20. I told my brother I would never do it again because having to spend a week in a 51/50 was one of the worst things ever. I wish I could be happy with doing nothing but I can't. The more I do nothing, the worse I feel. I want to have more than .33 cents in my account for once. I want to be able to do things. To go out and make friends, learn to drive, do things, but I can't. I'm stuck with a life that I don't want and  I'm not compatible with. \\n\\nThank you for letting vent. If anyone actually sees this, I hope you all are having a good day. \",\n",

I need to prepare and choose something to pursue in life but I just can’t bring myself to care about living right now. I’ve been sleep deprived too. Sleeping 5 hours a day just so I can scroll on my phone and practice my writing hobby or reading overdue books I need to return to the library without thinking about anything else. Even sleeping. I’m so tired of living. I don’t even wanna die really, not yet, I’d just rather accidentally die so I don’t have to live with myself.

       "     'selftext': 'This year is my senior year of high school and it was going well for me in the beginning of the year up until December. I have depression and anxiety and usually it gets worse when the weather gets colder and the days are shorter. Basically, one of my family members works at the school (not saying what or who but they play an important role) and everyone treats me like I’m supposed to be perfect and that I’m always supposed to be living up to be some smart person like my family member is. Anyways, back in November I had very good grades for the first time in my life I’m talking all A’s and everyone was proud of me. But his December I started to fall behind and get depressed again and lose my light and my grades went to crap. Like low 30’s. Bad. This started to make the teachers start talking to me about my grades and how it seems like I don’t care and how I’m not going to walk at graduation and how I’m going to fail and be a failure. It makes me feel like they only care about my grades and aren’t noticing that I’m sleeping in class and always tired and never awake and can’t walk straight and I’m only happy when I’m home. Every second someone is telling me to get my grades up. Like don’t you think I know! It’s all I hear every day of my life. “Did you get those grades up?” “Get your work done” “why don’t you care” I do care, a lot. I want to do these things and be smart and be a good student but I physically and mentally cannot and nobody understands me and everyone always brings it back to my grades. Even some of my friends think I’m lazy or something. And the teachers look at my friends and look back at me like they are a group of middle school girls. I feel like everyone hates me and only sees me as a failure and does not actually care about the root issues. It’s so bad that sometimes I don’t even have the energy to shower or take care of things or brush my teeth. I hate myself for being a failure and I even got rejected from my dream school which I knew was going to happen because of my grades. I’m not an idiot. I just want some advice since every therapist I’ve had isn’t helpful. I want some advice if that’s ok with yall, thanks.\\n',\n",

       " 'selftext': 'We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \\n\\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We\\'re hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \\n\\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it\\'s much better to respond in public comments, at least until you\\'ve gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###Summary###\\n\\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it\\'s unwise to trust them.** \\n\\n\\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it\\'s just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\\n\\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you\\'ll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you\\'ll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \\n\\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don\\'t give their names and callers aren\\'t allowed to request specific responders.  It\\'s much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it\\'s much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It\\'s partly about availability, but it\\'s mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \\n\\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it\\'s much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can\\'t see or police PMs.)  \\n\\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There\\'s no reason why someone who\\'s truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \\n\\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they\\'ve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone\\'s in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\\n\\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don\\'t recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.',\n",

(Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can&amp;#39;t see or police PMs.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our observation over many years, the people who say &amp;quot;PM me&amp;quot; the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. &lt;strong&gt;There&amp;#39;s no reason why someone who&amp;#39;s truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny&lt;/strong&gt;.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. &lt;strong&gt;If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they&amp;#39;ve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.&lt;/strong&gt; This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone&amp;#39;s in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don&amp;#39;t recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",
